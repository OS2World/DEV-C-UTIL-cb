             "C" Source Formatter   'Pretty Printer'


DESCRIPTION:
     This program takes as input a "C" source  program  file  and 
     formats  it with the proper indents for each statement.  The 
     original input file is renamed  as  a  .BAK  file,  and  the 
     formatted  output  is placed in a file with the same name as 
     the original input.  A command line option allows the indent 
     level to be specified as from 1 to 10 spaces (default = 4).


INVOCATION:
               CB inputfil [indent]

     inputfil       Input  "C" source program.   This file should 
                    be  a file that has compiled error  free,  as 
                    the formatter is not smart enough to pick  up 
                    syntax errors. Default extention = .c

     indent         This  is a number from 1 to 10 to specify the
                    number of spaces for each indent level.   The 
		    default spacing is 4.

HELP:
     Typing CB with no file name displays a short help reminder.
